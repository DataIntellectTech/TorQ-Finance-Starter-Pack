# TorQ-Finance-Starter-Pack
An example production ready market data capture system, using randomly generated financial data along with market data pulled from the IEX. The IEX feed was inspired by [Himanshu Gupta](http://www.enlistq.com/qkdb-api-getting-market-financial-data-iex/).

## Set Up

Assuming that the [free 32 bit version of kdb+](http://kx.com/software-download.php) is already set up and available from the command prompt as q, then:

1.  Download and install kdb+ from [Kx Systems](http://kx.com)

2.  Download the install script in the directory where you want the TorQ to be installed using:

    `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataIntellectTech/TorQ-Finance-Starter-Pack/master/installlatest.sh`
    
3. Run the appropriate starts script: start_torq_demo.bat for Windows, start_torq_demo_mac.sh for macOS, and torq.sh in the bin directory with the command line argument start all for Linux.

For more information on how to configure and get started, go to [this site](https://dataintellecttech.github.io/TorQ-Finance-Starter-Pack/).  You will need to make some modifications if you wish to send emails from the system.

## IEX API Information

The [IEX API](https://intercom.help/iexcloud/en) provides free data. It has recently changed and now requires an API Token to access the datafeed. To utilize the IEX feed provided by this Starter Pack, follow the instruction below.

To obtain a token, you must first create an [IEX Cloud Account](https://iexcloud.io/cloud-login#/register). Your token will be stored on [this page](https://iexcloud.io/console/token). Click on API Tokens to find your token.

Input your token to the IEX_PUBLIC_TOKEN variable in the file setenv.sh. Your token is now available to use as an enviroment variable.

Any changes to the API will be reflected in this TorQ pack.

[IEX Cloud Services Agreement](https://iexcloud.io/terms/https://iexcloud.io/terms/)

## Updating the Documentation with Mkdocs

To make changes to the documentation website you must simply use this command while in the branch you have made the changes on:

`mkdocs gh-deploy`

You will be prompted to enter a username and password, after this the site should have been updated. You can test the site locally if you want using mkdocs. First use the command:

`mkdocs build`

Then:

`mkdocs serve -a YourIp:Port`

Head to the address it gives you to check if your changes have worked. More information about using mkdocs can be found [here](http://www.mkdocs.org/)

## SSL Certificate

The web request that goes to the API provided by IEX goes through HTTPS. If the relevant security certificates are not installed then the data requests will fail. The setup is similar for Windows and Linux systems. To install the SSL ceritificates:

1. Install OpenSSL from [SLProWeb](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html). This should be installed as default on most Linux distributions.
2. Download the [certificate file](https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem).
3. The environment path must then be set in command prompt via ``setx SSL_CA_CERT_FILE C:\path\to\cacert.pem`` for Windows, and using ``export SSL_CA_CERT_FILE=path/to/cacert.pem`` for Linux.
